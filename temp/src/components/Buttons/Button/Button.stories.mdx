<Story id="components-buttons-button--types" />

The `Button` component is a near one-for-one clone of that from Salesforce's Lightning Design System in terms of styling. Small updates have been made to simplify the developer experience, as well as minor enhancements that separate Conga's look from that of LDS (e.g. an animated loader, mouse hover styles, etc.).

`Button` types are restricted to those defined by LDS, save for the "Success" option which not included currently.

To completely fulfill LDS `<button>` functionality:

- [ ] `leftIcon`
- [ ] `rightIcon`

## Quick Start ⚡️

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@one-conga/ui-components';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const handleClick = () => console.log('Ouch!');

  return <Button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me!</Button>;
};
```
