# ProgressBar

<Story id="components-progress-progressbar--default" />

The `ProgressBar` component is a near one-for-one clone of that from Salesforce's Lightning Design System in terms of styling. Small updates have been made to simplify the developer experience, as well as minor enhancements that separate Conga's look from that of LDS (e.g. an animated success icon/completion progress, etc.).

This component's width is determined by it's parent element and will fill 100% of that parent's width.

To completely fulfill LDS "Progress Bar" functionality:

- [ ] `orientation`: One of type `'horizontal' | 'vertical'` with default to `'horizontal'`; would need to reconsider/disable descriptive text with `'vertical'` orientation

## Quick Start ⚡️

```scss
// MyComponent.scss

.progress-container {
  width: 40rem;
  padding: 1rem;
}
```

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ProgressBar } from '@one-conga/ui-components';

import './MyComponent.scss';

const MyComponent = () => {
  // ...things

  return (
    <div className="progress-container">
      <ProgressBar
        itemsToComplete={[{ isComplete: true }, { isComplete: false }]}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```
