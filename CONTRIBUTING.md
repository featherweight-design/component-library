## Code of Conduct

Please thoroughly review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## I have a question

> **Note:** Please don't file an issue to ask a question. You'll receive a faster response by using one of the resources below.

The first place to start is referencing our [`README.md`](README.md).

Most issue specific questions can be answered by the issue's **"Acceptance Criteria"** and/or **"References"** section.

If talking to a real person is your jam, reach out to the `#questions` channel in our Slack and someone can point you in the right direction. If you've been assigned to a particular client for which you are developing in the component library, you should have a client specific channel as well (e.g. `#dfx`, `#rose-glass-design`, etc.).

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Commit types have have adopted are:
  - `fix` (PATCH)
  - `feat` (MINOR)
  - `BREAKING CHANGE` (MAJOR)
  - `build`
  - `chore`
  - `ci`
  - `docs`
  - `style`
  - `refactor`
  - `perf`
  - `test`
  - `optimization`
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less

### JavaScript Styleguide

- All JavaScript must adhere to our Prettier and Eslint formatting
- Destructuring should be used whenever possible
- Prefer the object spread operator (`{ ...anotherObj }` to `Object.assign()`)
- End of file over inline `export`s

  ```javascript
  // Use this:
  const Component = () => {};

  export default Component;

  // Instead of:
  export const Component = () => {};
  ```

- Place imports in the following order:
  - Third party Node Modules (such as `react`)
  - Local Modules (using relative paths)
  - Stylesheets
- Modules with five or more imports should have visual space above and below them

### TypeScript Styleguide

- TBD

### CSS Styleguide

- Component specific stylesheets should live in `/src/styles/components`
  - *Note: We do this to enable consumers of `@f-design/component-library` to override default SCSS variables*
- Components should be namespaced with `fd-` (e.g. `fd-button`)
- HEX values should be referenced as variables through `colors.scss`
- A loose BEM formatting should be used for classes:
  - Block: `fd-button`, `fd-checkbox`
  - Element: `fd-button__value`, `fd-checkbox__label`
  - Modifier: `fd-button__value-hidden`, `fd-checkbox-disabled`

### React Styleguide

- React hooks should be used for all state handling
- Actionable props should be prefaced with the word `on` (e.g. `onChange`, `onClose`, etc.)
- Methods passed to components as props should prefaced with the world `handle` (e.g. `handleChange`, `handleClose`, etc.)
- Any boolean props should be prefaced with the words `is/has/was` (e.g. `isLoading`, `hasData`, `wasSuccessful`, etc.)
- All possible states should be considered (e.g. empty, full, disabled, loading, etc.)

### Testing Styleguide

- Jest: TBD
- Cypress: TBD

## Your First Contribution

### Picking Up an Issue

- Find an issue that you are interested in the "To Do" column of the [Component Library project board](https://github.com/featherweight-design/component-library/projects/1)
- Ask to pick it up by either commenting on the issue itself or posting in #component-library
- Once approved, move your issue to the "In Progress" column of the project board
- Pull down the latest changes from `master` and checkout a new branch prefaced with your name (e.g. `hugh/icon-component`)

### I'm done, now what?

- Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
- Rebase with `master`
- Run `yarn release` to update the package version and `CHANGELOG.md`
- Push your changes to GitHub and open a new PR
- Fill out any relevant sections in the PR Template and remove those that are unused
- Run through the "Sanity Checks"
- GitHub will randomly assign someone to review your PR, but you are welcome to select additional reviewers

### Receiving Feedback

- Feedback is non-objective and in the best interest of the application
- Comments are meant to foster dialog, you are free to communicate your thought process and explain any reasoning to reach a joint decision
- When changes are requested, implement them to the best of your ability
- If you have questions, reach out to whomever requested changes or in Slack
- Admins reserve the right to dismiss PR approvals and change requests
